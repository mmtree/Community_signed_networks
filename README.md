# Community detectability and structural balance dynamics in signed networks

Dynamical signed networks are networks with both positive and negative connections that change over in response to influences. Networks under the influence of structural balance dynamics tend to form into either two antagonistic communities or one large harmonious community over time. We use simulations to show how networks that are initially complex with many clusters always converge to a low-dimensional structure with either 1 or 2 clusters and that these clusters are assortative in certain parameter regimes.  The final network states are a function of initial network statistics and we show how the contrast eigenvalue of the system breaks away from the remainder of the spectral band as one increases certain model parameters, generating a leading eigenvalue with assortative structure, and therefore a final network composed of this same structure.
